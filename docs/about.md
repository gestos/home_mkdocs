## what is this site?

It's actually pretty much a garbage dump for stuff I often google but can't remember.  
Also it's a learning tree for templating, "blogging" and playing around with "web" stuff.

I've heard that the average webpage these days is the size of the first "doom" game, so I'll try to help lowering that to a reasonable size again by setting up a website with little features and no content whatsoever.

Should you be in the mood to complain, you can do so. Just replace "complain" with "cheers" and write to complain@gestos.de
