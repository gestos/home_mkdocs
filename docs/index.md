# Hi

This is a blog-to-be, mainly to fiddle a bit with *mkdocs* because a static-site-generator seems like a nice thing.

apart from the fiddling, it's meant to be a personal homepage for me. my real name is known to those whom it concerns ;) 
a legal notice (german: "impressum", which is mandatory here) will follow soon. I guess.

This is/was the default vanilla mkdocs index page:


# Welcome to MkDocs

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).

## Commands

* `mkdocs new [dir-name]` - Create a new project.
* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs help` - Print this help message.

## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.
