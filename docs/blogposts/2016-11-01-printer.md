Network cups server up and running, avahi-systemd client also detecting the printer and printing fine

on the gentoo client however, no networked printer is detected. Quic solution for now:

* localhost:631 (attention: somehow I added a line to one of the numerous config files around that made me go directly to the print server address)
* add printer. for the correct https uri I just visited the server's cups interface server:631 and copied the link to the printer in the admin section (just: copy link address. this seems to bet the valid resource format)
* when given the choice for a ppd filter, NOT choosing a ppd is the important part. cups offers a "raw" ppd / queue. Ust this, assuming the correct ppd is already given on the server side.
* -> works fine.
