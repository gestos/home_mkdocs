~~~text
:set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS 
~~~
and the ctrl-x+ctrl-o will give the possible completions!

see [here](https://docs.oseems.com/general/application/vim/auto-complete-css)  
and [here](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Omni_completion)

the first one explains it very nicely and has a screenshot, too :-)
